<h2 id='applying-for-a-visa-through-the-government-or-a-third-party-visa-service'>Applying for a visa through the government or a third-party visa service</h2>
<p>When it comes to applying for a visa, you have two main options:  </p>
<p><strong>1. Apply directly through the government:</strong> Whether that's online or through an embassy or consulate.</p>
<p><strong>2. Apply with a trusted third-party visa service:</strong> Adding a layer of security, expert assistance, and a simple process.  </p>
<p>Some government websites are known for being difficult to navigate. Common issues include <strong>website crashes</strong>, endless questions, limited payment options and payment errors, and unclear processes.  </p>

<h2 id='understanding-visa-scams'>Understanding visa scams</h2>
<p>Visa scams are deceptive schemes designed to exploit individuals unfamiliar with visa procedures.</p>
<p>Scammers often create fake websites that look like legitimate visa service providers, making distinguishing between real and fraudulent platforms difficult.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>'I was tempted by a website offering an 'express visa' for just $50—way cheaper than the official fee. Everything looked legitimate until I noticed the website had <strong>no padlock in the address bar</strong> and the contact email was a generic Gmail account. That’s when I realized it was a scam and backed out just in time.'</em> — James, USA.</p>

<p>Here’s how to recognize potential scams and avoid them:  </p>
